The first ever game I made at NU. It's a very simple text-based RPG that uses racket.

We were asked to include a tip for playing the game in the original README:

Hello! Thank you for playing! Honestly I think it's pretty straightforward 
because I included some instructions when you're playing the game itself
but I mean I guess a tip is that pretty much everything is interactable
so you might find some cool stuff by (examine)ing certain things and stuff.
Oh and also make sure your command window is large and wide or else the text
boxes won't work that well. Like if you're getting like a crazy random mess
of random characters everywhere chances are you just need to stretch out the
window you're playing in. Anyway, again thanks for playing! Enjoy!
